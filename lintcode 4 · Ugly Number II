用heap，heappop每次只会弹出最小的数字,set用来去重
```
import heapq

class Solution:
    """
    @param n: An integer
    @return: return a  integer as description.
    """
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n):
        # write your code here
        heap = [1]
        seen = set([])
        cur_ugly = 1

        for _ in range(n):
            cur_ugly = heapq.heappop(heap)
            for factor in [2,3,5]:
                new_ugly = cur_ugly*factor
                if new_ugly not in seen:
                    seen.add(new_ugly)
                    heapq.heappush(heap, new_ugly)
        return cur_ugly



```
